# ISO3166-to-GPS
CSV datatable giving the center point for all ISO registered Country.

The dataset column are, in order: 
The ISOcodes in alphanumeric2/3 and numeric3 ("alpha2" - "alpha3" - "iso_num")
Country names, short and full ("shortCountry" - "country")
The GPS coordinates of the middle points ("lat" - "long")

Kosovo is not listed as an ISO standard country. The unofficial 2 and 3-digit codes are used by the European Commission and others until Kosovo is assigned an ISO code. It's still in this datatable but marked with an [UNOFFICIAL] tag.
Be carefull with Namibia, the Isocode of this country being NA you can have a not defined value if you dont read it properly !

If you want to help, just commit more precise coordinates !
